- Review: Darcy Rose - all of the elements of the hotel website are technically there but it definitely still needs styling. The navbar and the paradise section especially could use some lovin'. Images need some resizing for sure.

Responsiveness: The sections get a little distorted when you shift to tablet, and when you shift to mobile things get extra funky. I like the way the reserve a room is configured, though. I never thought to do the four inputs in a quadrant layout.

Keep at it, I believe in you :9
